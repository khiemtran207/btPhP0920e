	<h1>I like to go swimming in the summer</h1>
	<p>swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backard pool. It's not an impressive poll, only three feet dêp, but it's mine</p>
	<p>Three are three reasons I like to swim:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I get lots of exercise</li>
		<li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
		<li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun</li>
	</ul>
